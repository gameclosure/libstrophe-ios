libstrophe-ios
==============

iOS version of libstrophe that does not require OpenSSL.  This produces i386 simulator, armv7 and armv7s fat static library output from the latest expat and libstrophe source code.

We added the Apple Secure Transport TLS wrapper and are considering contributing a patch back after more testing.
